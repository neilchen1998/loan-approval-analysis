# Analyzing Important Factors in the Loan Approval Process


## Overview

This project looks into the factors that hold the most weight when an applicant’s loan is approved or denied within
the state of California. The motivation for this is to provide more transparency regarding the loan approval process, especially in
a time where more and more Californians are looking towards taking out loans to afford buying a home. The data set used in
this project is taken from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Factors such as the applicant’s race, income, locale,
and sex are analyzed. Both decision tree and k-means clustering machine learning models are used to predict whether given loan
applications are approved or denied.
